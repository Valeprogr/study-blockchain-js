## Proof of Work (PoW)

PoW is a decentralized blockchain consensus mechanism that requires network participants to perform computational work by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.

This process, known as mining, rewards participants for successfully validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain.

PoW ensures secure peer-to-peer transaction processing without relying on a central authority or trusted third party.

However, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy, and its energy demand increases as more miners join the network, making scalability a challenge.
